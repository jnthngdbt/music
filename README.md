## JG.1

Released in january 2017. An attempt at describing the genre would be 'short simple melodic instrumental punk rock' songs. The recording session files (.band) are for iOS GarageBand. 

The album artwork is a beeple piece, available under Creative Commons license:

A note about the song 'Jump'. It actually started as a jam on the introduction riff of the song 'Cliff Jumper' from the band Modern Ghost and it ended up being a song. So, in the end, 'Jump' is basically a cover of the 'Cliff Jumper' intro.

A note for the fine bassist ears. I intentionally replicated the recorded bass pattern found on Blink 182's Enema of the State by using a Fender Precision Bass for some songs and an Ernie Ball Music Man Bass for other songs. My hope is that someone that had noticed this on Enema of the State has a mini mind explosion to find out that someone has done the same thing on purpose. Then we could intellectually connect and become best friends.

## BEVERLY ALY HILLS

Single released in june 2017. The recording session file (.band) is for iOS GarageBand. 

In maybe two or three weeks (from this track's release date), my baby will be born into existence. Her name is Aly. Randomly, I wanted to do a cover of the main theme of the 90's television series 'Beverly Hills, 90210', maybe because it captures exactly how I feel about her upcoming (not the actual series plot, but the song). Beverly Alills, Bervaly Hills, I went with Beverly Aly Hills. 

I want to release a small album of soft short songs soon especially for her (she already listened to the songs a lot) and this song is the perfect transition between the 'boom pow wham' of my previous album and the 'doo di bou' of the upcoming one, so I release it now as a 'single'. 

The artwork is a patch from the 1987 movie poster of 'Beverly Hills Cop 2'. I really cropped Eddie Murphy, he was on the right. I don't know what I just did copyright wise.
